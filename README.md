Title: Personal Portfolio - Mobile Skeleton

Description:
As an aspiring computer scientist, I am embarking on a project to build my own personal portfolio using HTML and CSS, with a focus on mobile design.

Key Features:
1. Responsive Design: The portfolio will be optimized for mobile devices, ensuring that it looks and functions well on smaller screens.
2. Navigation Menu: A navigation menu will be included to provide easy access to different sections of the portfolio.
3. Link to Personal Account: The portfolio will feature a link to my personal account, allowing visitors to connect with me or view additional information.

Customization:
The project provides flexibility for customization. I can modify the content within each section, add or remove sections based on my preferences, and apply my own styling to create a unique and personalized portfolio.
